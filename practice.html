  <p class="spacing">It's great to be able to control spacing between letters, words and lines, but, unless you're a professional designer, it's a good idea not to try to be too creative with these options.</p>
  <p class="alignment">Justified text has always been used by professional designers. Before word processing came along, justification made text look professionally "typeset" since a typewriter couldn't do it. But now that almost any word processor can even out the right edge, justification doesn't have the prestige it used to enjoy. And, if a block of text is narrow, with few words per line, things can get pretty ugly, thanks to all those big gaps between words. These days, it's harder to justify justification.

  <p class="tabbed">Whether you indent the first line of a paragraph or not, and how much you indent, is a matter of taste. Some designers prefer to separate paragraphs with whitespace, specifying bottom margins. Other designers like to indent the first line. Usually, when one method is used, the other method is not used.</p>
  <blockquote><p>By default, a blockquote is set in. Optionally, you can also style it, as I do here by specifying grey in the CSS. Frequently, designers also change the size of blockquote text, making it either smaller or larger than normal text. And, of course, you can change the font-family if you want to. But avoid fancy fonts, please.</p></blockquote>
  <p class="offset">This paragraph has extra whitespace all around it. Offsetting text this way signals to the reader that the content is outside the flow of the main body of text.</p>
  <h3 class="enclosed">Later, you'll learn to use borders more aesthetically.</h3>
  <p class="mid">In general, it's best to center short text, like headings and paragraphs that contain just a few words. When you center longer passages, even a couple of sentences like this, you make the text hard to read and give an impression of flakiness.</p>
  <h4>Centered headings are classy.</h4>
